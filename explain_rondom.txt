It's very similar to the previous version, only instead of making a function that takes a generator
and then calls itself recursively with the new updated generator, we do all the work in main. After
telling the user whether they were correct in their guess or not, we update the global generator
and then call main again. Both approaches are valid but I like the first one more since it does less
stuï¬€ in main and also provides us with a function that we can reuse easily
